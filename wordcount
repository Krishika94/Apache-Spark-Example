Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size. 
It provides development APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and supports code reuse across multiple workloads—batch processing, interactive queries, real-time analytics, machine learning, and graph processing. 
You’ll find it used by organizations from any industry, including at FINRA, Yelp, Zillow, DataXu, Urban Institute, and CrowdStrike.
Apache Spark has become one of the most popular big data distributed processing framework with 365,000 meetup members in 2017.
